When I'm not working on security I'm most likely tinkering with computers or frequencies. A lot of people like my research within the malicious use of infrasonic/ultrasonic frequencies, you can read about it [here](https://littlefield.co/the-psychoacoustic-effect-of-infrasonic-sonic-and-ultrasonic-frequencies-within-non-lethal-cf05e1fd8673).
