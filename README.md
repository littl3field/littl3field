## 👋 Into:

I am a Security Analyst at the [Microsoft Security Response Centre (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc) and this is my personal Github page. I work on digital forensics and incident response in-line with threat intelligence, malware, reverse engineering and automation. I love to write in python and love open source security tools.

## 🌎 Other: 

When I'm not working on security I'm most likely tinkering with computers or frequencies. I've done a large amount of research here and given a few talks, please reach out if you'd like to chat. A lot of people like my research within the malicious use of infrasonic/ultrasonic frequencies, you can read about it [here](https://littlefield.co/the-psychoacoustic-effect-of-infrasonic-sonic-and-ultrasonic-frequencies-within-non-lethal-cf05e1fd8673).
