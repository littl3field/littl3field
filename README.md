## 🌎 Other: 

When I'm not working on security I'm most likely exploring the mind, tinkering with computers or frequencies. I'm passionate about meditation, frequencies, energy and quantum thoery. My research extends from using [machine learning for natural language processing in the darkweb](https://littlefield.co/cyber-threat-intelligence-applying-machine-learning-data-mining-and-text-feature-extraction-to-bb00c3b729bc?source=collection_home---2------7-----------------------) to [ultrasonic frequency weapons](https://littlefield.co/the-psychoacoustic-effect-of-infrasonic-sonic-and-ultrasonic-frequencies-within-non-lethal-cf05e1fd8673). Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat or for enquiring on talks. References to my work:
