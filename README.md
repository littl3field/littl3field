## 👋 Intro:

I am a Security Analyst at the [Microsoft Security Response Centre (MSRC)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc) and this is my personal Github page. I work on digital forensics and incident response in-line with threat intelligence, malware, reverse engineering and automation. I love to write in python and love open source security tools.

## 🤖 Projects:

- [Audix](https://github.com/littl3field/Audix) - A PowerShell tool to quickly configure the Windows Event Audit Policies for monitoring & incident response.
- [DomainWildcarder](https://github.com/littl3field/DomainWildcarder) - A commandline tool to wildcard domain registrations against the RIPE database.

## 🌎 Other: 

When I'm not working on security I'm most likely tinkering with computers or frequencies. My research extends from using [machine learning for natural language processing in the darkweb](https://littlefield.co/cyber-threat-intelligence-applying-machine-learning-data-mining-and-text-feature-extraction-to-bb00c3b729bc?source=collection_home---2------7-----------------------) to [ultrasonic frequency weapons](https://littlefield.co/the-psychoacoustic-effect-of-infrasonic-sonic-and-ultrasonic-frequencies-within-non-lethal-cf05e1fd8673).
